I made this website as my Human lanugage Tech (CS 4395.001) HW1 Submission. I'm Nicolas Bastos Megias (nxb200040).


Each tab on the website corresponds to a problem in the homework.

For each problem, there is a picture of my submission in the /public/ directory.


You can see my regex strings in /src/pieces/regex/RegexQuestion.tsx
You can see my Wagner-Fischer implementation in src/hooks/useCanvas.tsx
You can see my user id regex pattern in src/pieces/FileUpload.tsx



Project made with React + Vite. Tailwindcss for styling.
